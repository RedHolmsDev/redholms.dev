redholms.dev website

## What's this about?
This website is just a playground for me to research web development. I wanna make some basic registation/login stuff, maybe connect db to it
 and just make generic full-stack web application. Also I'm thinking about making it available for thrid-party OAuth services, i.e. "Login with redholms.dev"
 buttons and all of that (like MetaID or similar I suppose).

My another crazy idea is to make sort of ecosystem of website, all connected to that "redholms id", similar to what Apple, Amazon, Meta and other bit companies do.  
Actually I'm intersted only in making porn website (like rule34, but better, of course) and maybe music website (like spotify, maybe even desktop app).
I don't know will I do all of that or not (99%), but this is just my ideas of what to do.
